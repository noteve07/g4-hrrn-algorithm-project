# G4 HRRN Algorithm Project

## Description
This project implements the Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) scheduling algorithm in Java. The HRRN algorithm prioritizes processes based on their waiting and execution times to optimize scheduling in operating systems. It helps improve efficiency by ensuring that shorter processes are completed first while also considering longer processes.
